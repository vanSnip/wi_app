Welcome to the basic sugarcane farming guide: 

This guide gives steps to help you grow healthy sugarcane and increase profits. 

1. Choose Good Planting Material 
- Use healthy, disease-free cane stalks (2–3 buds each). 
- Choose varieties suited to your region. 

2. Prepare the Land 
- Deep plough the field to loosen the soil. 
- Add compost or manure to enrich the land. 
- Make ridges or furrows for planting. 

3. Plant at the Right Time 
- Best time: end of dry season or start of rainy season. 
- Place cane stalks horizontally in furrows and cover with soil. 

4. Use Water Wisely 
- Keep soil moist, especially in the first 60–90 days. 
- Use furrow irrigation if available; avoid waterlogging. 

5. Use Fertiliser Correctly 
- Apply nitrogen and potash 30–45 days after planting. 
- Repeat after 3 months. 

6. Harvest at the Right Time 
- Harvest 10–12 months after planting (depending on variety). 
- Look for dry leaves, swollen internodes, and sweet juice.
