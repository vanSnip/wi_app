Welcome to the basic rice farming guide: 

This guide gives simple steps to help you grow rice successfully, even in challenging conditions. 

1. Choose Good Seeds 
- Use clean and healthy seeds. 
- Get them from trusted sources to ensure strong plants. 

2. Prepare Your Land 
- Level your field so water spreads evenly. 
- Remove weeds and leftover plants from the last season. 
- Use compost or animal manure to improve the soil. 

3. Plant at the Right Time 
- Transplant rice seedlings 20–25 days after sowing. 

4. Use Water Wisely 
- Keep water 2–5 cm deep in the field while the rice is growing. 

5. Use Fertiliser Correctly 
- Apply fertiliser when rice is growing and when grains start forming. 

6. Harvest at the Right Time 
- Harvest when about 85 percent of the grains are yellow. 
- Do not wait too long—grains may fall to the ground. 

Tip: If your field has salty water (common in southern Vietnam), use salt-tolerant rice varieties.
