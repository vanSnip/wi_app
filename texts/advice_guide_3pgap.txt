Welcome to the information page of the three main principles of conservation agriculture: 

Principle 1: Minimal soil disturbance 
This means that the soil should not be ploughed or tilled, as this can damage the soil structure and lead to erosion. 
The advantages are: 
protectsion against wind and erosion: 
Improves the quality of the orgainic matter in the soil: 
Decreases the costs in the long term: 
Improves the water take up and retention. 
The fertiliser becomes more effective. 

Principle 2: Permanent soil cover with organic matters 
This means that the soil is covered with organic matter, such as crop residues or cover crops, to protect it from erosion and improve its fertility. 
Advantages: 
Protection from erosion from wind and water: 
It recycles the use of nutrients: 
Suppresses the growth of weeds (unwanted plants): 
Improves accumalation of organic matter, further enhancing the effect: 

Principle 3: Crop rotation and intercropping 
This means that different crops are grown in the same field after each other, to improve soil fertility and reduce pests and diseases. 
The effect is the best if the crops are different families, such as legumes and cereals. 
Advantages: 
Improves the soil fertility and structure: 
Reduces the risk of pests and diseases: 
Increases the water use:
