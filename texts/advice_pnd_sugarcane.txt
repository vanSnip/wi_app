To keep sugarcane healthy and free from pests and diseases: 

- Watch for pests like sugarcane borers and aphids. 
- Look for diseases such as red rot or leaf scald (discolored or dead patches). 
- Use natural control methods or recommended pesticides carefully. 
- Check fields often for signs of pest damage or disease symptoms. 
- Avoid excess nitrogen fertiliser, which can encourage pest problems. 
- After harvest, remove or burn diseased stalks and plant debris.
