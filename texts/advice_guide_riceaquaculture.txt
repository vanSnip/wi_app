Welcome to the information page of rice–aquaculture systems: 

Rice–aquaculture systems are farming methods that combine rice growing with raising aquatic animals like shrimp or fish. These systems help farmers adapt to climate change, improve soil health, and increase income. 

This method is especially useful as the climate becomes more unpredictable, with: 
1. Salty water during dry seasons 
2. Unpredictable rainfall 
3. Flooding and drought 

There are two main types of rice–aquaculture systems used in Vietnam: 

1. Rice–Shrimp Rotation: 
- Suitable for areas with seasonal salinity (saltwater). 
- Shrimp are raised in the dry season when water is salty. 
- In the rainy season, rainwater cleans the soil and prepares it for rice. 
- Shrimp waste gives nutrients to the rice. 
- Rice helps loosen and clean the soil for the next shrimp season. 
- This system is common in the Mekong Delta. 

2. Rice–Fish Co-Cultivation: 
- Rice and fish are grown in the same field. 
- Helps keep rice yields strong and provides fish for food and extra income. 
- Supports household food security. 
- Must be managed carefully to avoid environmental problems. 

The Vietnamese government (MARD) is helping farmers with policies to support integrated farming. 
- Farmers are encouraged to convert low-yield rice fields into rice–aquaculture areas. 
- These systems improve profitability and climate resilience. 

Below is a simple guide for rice–fish cultivation: 

Start of the rainy season (May–June): 
- Transplant rice as soon as the soil is moist. 
- After 2 weeks, when rice is stable, stock the fish. 

If heavy rain or flooding is expected: 
- Wait to plant rice and add fish until water is stable. 

In dry periods: 
- Water the rice regularly. 
- Shade the fish with floating plants. 
- Reduce fish feeding to prevent water stress. 

Before a storm or typhoon: 
- Harvest mature rice and fish early. 
- Move fish to safer ponds if possible. 

A step-by-step guide is available to help you implement rice–aquaculture systems on your farm.
