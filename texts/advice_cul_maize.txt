Welcome to the basic maize farming guide: 

This guide helps you grow healthy maize plants and improve your harvest. 

1. Choose Good Seeds 
- Select high-yield and drought-tolerant maize varieties. 
- Use certified seeds from trusted suppliers. 

2. Prepare the Land 
- Plough the land well and break large soil clumps. 
- Add compost or manure before planting to enrich the soil. 

3. Plant at the Right Time 
- Plant just before or at the start of the rainy season. 
- Leave 25–30 cm between plants and 70–90 cm between rows. 

4. Use Water Wisely 
- Maize needs more water during flowering and grain-filling stages. 
- Avoid waterlogging—ensure good drainage. 

5. Use Fertiliser Correctly 
- Apply nitrogen-rich fertiliser when plants are knee-high. 
- Apply again when tassels appear. 

6. Harvest at the Right Time 
- Harvest when cobs are dry and kernels are hard (husks turn brown). 
- Dry the maize properly to avoid mold.
