To protect your rice from pests and diseases, remember: 

- Watch for insects like brown planthopper and diseases like leaf spots. 
- Use natural methods or approved chemicals to control pests safely. 
- Check your fields often for discolored spots â€” early detection helps prevent spread. 
- Avoid using too much fertiliser, especially nitrogen, as it can increase pests. 
- After harvest, burn or remove diseased plant debris to stop pests from returning.
